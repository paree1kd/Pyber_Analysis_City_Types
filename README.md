# Pyber Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
### Pyber, a ridesharing company, has called on for a project to analyze their data to figure out the metric regarding total weekly fares, using city type (urban, rural, suburban). The datasets analyzed for this project gave insight on total fares, drivers, and rides, which led to the calculation of the averages of those metrics and their city types. 

### The dataset was also utilized to create a brand new data frame for average fare per week from a specified point of time, which for the purpose of this analysis was January 1st, 2019 to April 28th, 2019 for each type of city. After the development of the dataframe, a multi-line graph was crated to show total weekly fare by each city type. With this output, the information was provided to Pyber's chief executive officer to address issues in the output by type of city.
